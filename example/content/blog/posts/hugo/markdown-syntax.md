# So, what is markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.

# Codeblocks
```CPP
#include <iostream>
// Hello
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
